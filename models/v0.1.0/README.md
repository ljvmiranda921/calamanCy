# ü™ê spaCy Project: Release v0.1.0

This is a spaCy project that trains the v0.1.0 models for calamanCy. You can
use this project to replicate the pipelines shipped by the project. First, you
need to install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the set-up commands:

```
python -m spacy project assets
python -m spacy project run setup
```

This step downloads all assets and prepares all the datasets and binaries for
training use.  You can then train a pipeline by passing its name to the spaCy
project command. For example, if you wish to train `tl_calamancy_md`, you can
execute the corresponding workflow like so:

```
python -m spacy project run tl-calamancy-md 
```

## Model information

The table below shows an overview of the calamanCy models in this project. For more information,
I suggest checking the [language pipeline metadata](https://spacy.io/api/language#meta).

|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tl_calamancy_md (73.7 MB)   | tok2vec, tagger, morphologizer, parser, ner | CPU-optimized Tagalog NLP model. Pretrained using the TLUnified dataset. Using floret vectors (50k keys)     |
| tl_calamancy_lg (431.9 MB)  | tok2vec, tagger, morphologizer, parser, ner | CPU-optimized large Tagalog NLP model. Pretrained using the TLUnified dataset. Using fastText vectors (714k) |

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.
