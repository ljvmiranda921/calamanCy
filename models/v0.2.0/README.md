# ü™ê Weasel Project: Release v0.2.0

This is a spaCy project that trains the v0.2.0 models for calamanCy.
Here are some of the major changes in this release:

- **Included trainable lemmatizer in the pipeline**: instead of a rules-based
lemmatizer, we are now using the [neural edit-tree
lemmatizer](https://explosion.ai/blog/edit-tree-lemmatizer).
- **Trained on UD-NewsCrawl**: this is a major update, as we are now training
our parser, tagger, and morphologizer components on the larger
[UD-NewsCrawl](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UD-Filipino/UD_Tagalog-NewsCrawl)
treebank.  Our training dataset has now increased from 150+ to 15,000! From
this point forward, we will be using the UD-TRG and UD-Ugnayan treebanks as
test sets (as intended).
- **Better evaluations**: Aside from evaluating our dependency parser and POS tagger on UD-TRG and UD-Ugnayan, we have also included Universal NER ([Mayhew et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09122)) as our test set for evaluating the NER component.
- **Improved base model for tl_calamancy_trf**: Based on internal evaluations, we are now using [mDeBERTa-v3 (base)](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/mdeberta-v3-base) as our source of context-sensitive vectors for tl_calamancy_trf.
- **Simpler pipelines, no more pretraining**: We found that pretraining doesn't really offer huge performance gains (0-1%) given the huge effort and time needed to do it. Hence, for ease of training the whole pipeline, we removed it from the calamanCy recipe.

The namespaces for the latest models remain the same.
The legacy models will have an explicit version number in their HuggingFace repositories.
Please see [this HuggingFace collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/ljvmiranda921/calamancy-models-for-tagalog-nlp-65629cc46ef2a1d0f9605c87) for more information.

## Set-up

You can use this project to replicate the pipelines shipped by the project.
First, you need to install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the set-up commands:

```sh
python -m spacy project assets
python -m spacy project run setup
```

This step downloads all assets and prepares all the datasets and binaries for
training use. For example, if you want to train `tl_calamancy_md`, run the following comand:

```sh
MODEL=tl_calamancy_md scripts/train.sh
```


## Model information

The table below shows an overview of the calamanCy models in this project. For more information,
I suggest checking the [language pipeline metadata](https://spacy.io/api/language#meta).

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`weasel run [name]`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#rocket-run)
