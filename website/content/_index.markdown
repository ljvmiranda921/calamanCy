# calamanCy: NLP pipelines for Tagalog

**calamanCy** is a Tagalog natural language preprocessing framework made with [spaCy](https://spacy.io).
Its goal is to provide pipelines and datasets for downstream NLP tasks.
calamanCy takes inspiration from other language-specific spaCy Universe frameworks such as [DaCy](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/DaCy) and [huSpaCy](https://github.com/huspacy/huspacy).
The name is based from _calamansi_, a citrus fruit native to the Philippines and used in traditional Filipino cuisine.
