# calamanCy: NLP pipelines for Tagalog

**calamanCy** is a Tagalog natural language preprocessing framework made with [spaCy](https://spacy.io).
Its goal is to provide pipelines and datasets for core NLP tasks such as dependency parsing, morphological analysis, parts-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
calamanCy takes inspiration from other language-specific spaCy frameworks such as [DaCy](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/DaCy) (Danish) and [huSpaCy](https://github.com/huspacy/huspacy) (Hungarian).

The name is based from _calamansi_, a citrus fruit native to the Philippines and used in traditional Filipino cuisine.
