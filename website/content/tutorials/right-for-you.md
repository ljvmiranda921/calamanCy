Before we start with all the tips and tricks on how to use calamanCy, I believe it is important to first ask the question: **is calamanCy right for you?**
calamanCy may be the best fit for your use-case if you are...

- Doing **linguistic analysis and annotation** such as parts-of-speech tagging or dependency parsing.
- Looking for an **efficient and low-cost** tool for extracting information from text.

I don't think calamanCy is the best fit for you if you are **interested in more complex downstream tasks**, like search.
Back then, you do need tools like calamanCy (or spaCy) to extract named-entities as keywords and then integrating them into a semantic search workflow.
However, innovations like LLM-based [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation)-based workflows made these processes easier to do without training or finetuning!

Although calamanCy focuses on Filipino, **modern LLMs are starting to cater to non-English languages**.
These include [Llama 3.1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/), [Aya Expanse](https://cohere.com/blog/aya-expanse-connecting-our-world), and [Gemma 2](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) to name a few.
I have a few thoughts on this (and the future of Filipino NLP) in another [blog post](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2024/12/17/filipino-llm/).
