"""Get nearest language given a language code using WALS

This script attempts to give you the nearest language for a given target using
the typological features found in WALS. A lot of these methods are based from
the work, Cross-lingual parser selection for low-resource languages, by Zeljko
Agic.

The code was adapted from the original repository:
